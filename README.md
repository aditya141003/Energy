Energy Consumption Forecasting


This repository contains the project Energy Consumption Forecasting, which involves predicting future energy consumption using various machine learning techniques, including Time Series Analysis and Regression Models, with a specific focus on the XGBoost algorithm. The project is implemented using Python, R, and other relevant technologies.



Project Overview
The objective of this project is to forecast energy consumption based on historical data. Accurate energy forecasting is crucial for optimizing energy distribution, reducing costs, and improving energy management. This project leverages machine learning algorithms, particularly XGBoost, to model and predict energy usage patterns, thereby providing actionable insights for energy management.


Results
The project provides predictions on energy consumption and visualizes these predictions through various plots. The accuracy of the predictions is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). XGBoost is employed to achieve robust and accurate forecasting results, thanks to its efficiency in handling large datasets and its capability of capturing complex patterns in the data.
